# **VTA snRNA-seq**


This page contains R code for analysis of single-nucleus RNA-seq (snRNA-seq) datasets from "_An atlas of transcriptionally defined cell populations in the rat ventral tegmental area_".  R objects containing UMAP coordinates and other metadata characteristics for the complete dataset and neuronal sub-clustering are available upon request. 


## **Study design**

This snRNA-seq dataset was generated from VTA punches from naive adult male and female Sprague Dawley rats.  

Datasets in this preprint used the 10X Genomics Chromium Single Cell Next GEM 3â€™ library construction kit to generate barcoded libraries for Illumina sequencing. For each dataset, we provide R Markdown and Word documents containing analysis parameters and code.

## **Source code**
All packages required for reproduction of this analysis are included in the session info section of the word doc included in this repository.
[Seurat v3.2.2](https://github.com/satijalab/seurat)  

## **Docker image**
A Docker image containing all depedencies needed to reproduce the analysis from the code present in this repository: [Day lab VTA Docker image](https://hub.docker.com/r/daylabprojects/daylab_rat_vta_snrna)

The Dockerfile associated with this image can be found [here](https://github.com/Jeremy-Day-Lab/VTA_Dockerfiles/blob/master/Dockerfile_additional_seurat_dependencies/Dockerfile)

Overall this image contains the minimum dependencies to reproduce the Day lab VTA analysis code, and a number of additional Seurat dependencies which were not used in the analysis (e.g.: DESeq2, multtest, metap which are needed for specific differential expression parameters or functions such as `FindConservedMarkers`) but can aid in the utilization of the container for exploratory purposes.
