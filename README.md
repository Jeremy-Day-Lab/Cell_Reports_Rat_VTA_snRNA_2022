# **VTA snRNA-seq**


This page contains R code for analysis of single-nucleus RNA-seq (snRNA-seq) datasets from "An Atlas of Transcriptionally Distinct Cell Populations within the Rat Ventral Tegmental Area".  


## **Study design**

This snRNA-seq dataset was generated from VTA punches from naive adult male and female Sprague Dawley rats.  

Datasets in this preprint used the 10X Genomics Chromium Single Cell 3â€™ library construction kit to generate barcoded libraries for Illumina sequencing. For each dataset, we provide R Markdown and Word documents containing analysis parameters and code.
